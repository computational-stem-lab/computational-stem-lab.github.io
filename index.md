# Who are we

Computational STEM Lab is a UChicago student, staff, and faculty-led organization working to build interest in the computational sciences. We connect pre-college students with scientists from all levels of training by hosting educational coding workshops on and off campus. Our past workshops have served students from Bishop Noll High School in Indiana and Rauner College Prep in Chicago. Weâ€™re especially passionate about engaging with students from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in STEM, those who would be the first in their family to attend college and/or those from low-income households.

# For students

We develop scientific programming tutorials for high school students using Jupyter notebooks. To explore our lessons at home using myBinder, click here:
